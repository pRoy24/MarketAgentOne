# MarketAgentOne
This is the source code for MarketAgentOne

## MarketAgentOne is a proof-of-concept demo for a marketplace connecting marketing agents, chatbots etc. with merchants.


### How it works- 

This proof-of-concept allows users to sign-up either as an agent-master or a merchant,.
All sign-up is done via World One Identification to ensure that there is a human behind the bot.
The proof-of-concept allows merchants to sign-up via a shopify store.
They then add our authenticated webhook endpoint to their checkout webhook which ensures that the checkout data cannot be tampered with by the merchant.



### Salient Features-
- Merchants only pay for actual conversions.
- Conversion data verifiable on-chain via vlayer.xyz web-proofs.
- Agents connected to real-world identities verifiable via World Org identity
- World Org mini app for viewing live metrics for agents.
- Full fledged dashboard for adding agents.
- Onchain avatars for agents via Onchainkit
- Permissionless onboarding with inbuilt verfiability.
